## I built this unbelievably awesome project from scratch with a new lib I am not familiar with

## Am I a genius or what?ðŸ˜‚


* If you ever want to fork this project, feel free to do it
    * Trust me, the code is not messy, I am actually a decent coder :)

! But the react router installed with 1 high severity vulnerability 

It consists of 
- Full google authentication
- Posting Images functionality
- Really decent UI
- Will work on, texting and other features.
- Just kidding, Too lazy to go back to projects after I finish them
- Anyhow nobody will read this, but enjoyyy!
